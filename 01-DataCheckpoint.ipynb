    "Admission decisions at selective public universities shape not only the composition of the student body but also reflect institutional priorities and structural constraints. Within the University of California (UC) system, campuses receive applications from multiple residency categories, including California residents (in-state), domestic non-residents (out-of-state), and international applicants. These groups differ in tuition structure, financial contribution, and application volume, making comparisons of admission and enrollment outcomes particularly important. UC San Diego (UCSD), as a highly selective public research institution, provides a useful context for examining how admission rates and yield rates vary across residency groups. Public UC admissions datasets provide counts of applicants, admitted students, and enrolled students by residency status, enabling direct analysis of both admission probabilities and post-admission enrollment behavior.<a href=\" \">1</a >\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research and institutional analyses have emphasized that understanding university access requires examining rates rather than only aggregate enrollment numbers. Summaries provided by the University of California Office of the President highlight how Proposition 209 reshaped admissions practices and underscore the importance of evaluating application, admission, and enrollment patterns separately.<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a > These analyses suggest that raw enrollment totals alone may obscure underlying differences in admissions dynamics. Empirical work examining UC admissions policies similarly demonstrates that changes in student composition may arise from shifts in applicant behavior, selection processes, and institutional factors, motivating closer examination of admission probabilities across groups.<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a >\n",
    "\n",
    "Contemporary reporting further illustrates the relevance of residency-based comparisons. Recent coverage by the Los Angeles Times documents record numbers of California applicants alongside continued international enrollment growth, highlighting how applicant pools and admissions outcomes may evolve over time.<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a > Policy commentary also points to structural barriers affecting California students, including disparities in academic preparation and access to advising resources, which may influence both application behavior and admissions outcomes.<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a > Together, these discussions motivate systematic quantitative investigation of how admission rates and yield rates differ across residency categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on prior work, this project investigates how admission rates and yield rates differ for international, out-of-state, and in-state undergraduate applicants to UC San Diego between 2020 and 2025, and whether gaps between these groups have widened or narrowed over time.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there are distinct patterns across first generation, undocumented, and international students admitted to UC San Diego(2020-2025) across ethnicity, gender, and intended major. Specifically, due to cultural and economic factors, we believe that first generation and International will share considerable concentration in STEM-based majors, and that first generation will have a disproportionate percentage of underrepresented ethnicities while international students will show a different distribution of ethnicities and genders. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that the focus on STEM majors is influenced by economic stability. International students have increased costs due to travel and education expenses which may incentivize financial predictability with potential of high return when picking a major. Similarly, first generation students may prefer STEM as there is a higher financial floor and increased opportunities following graduation. On the other hand, first generation students may be disproportionately underrepresented ethnicities due to historical disparities in K-12 education, college counseling, and opportunity. International students have differing constraints which come in the form of restrictions of certain countries to send students to the US as well as socioeconomic differences across the world.  \n"

    "### Admission and yield rates over 9 year at UCSD Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Description: UCSD Common Data Set (2017–2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "The UCSD Common Data Set (CDS) is an annual institutional report that provides standardized information on admissions, enrollment, and financial characteristics. The dataset consists of aggregated statistics, typically reported as counts, proportions, or percentages rather than individual-level records. Central variables for this project include the admission rate, defined as the proportion of applicants offered admission, and the yield rate, defined as the percentage of admitted students who ultimately enroll. These metrics are unitless proportions that capture different stages of the admissions pipeline: selection and post-admission decision-making. Because the CDS reports values by residency categories (in-state, out-of-state, international), it enables comparisons across applicant groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial variables in the CDS provide important context for interpreting these outcomes. Total Estimated Expenses, measured in U.S. Dollars (USD), represent the annual cost of attendance. Non-resident students (out-of-state and international) face substantially higher tuition than California residents, often exceeding $70,000 per year. Academic preparation measures, such as High School GPA, are reported on a weighted 4.0 scale and serve as standardized indicators of applicant academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major Concerns and Potential Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "Several limitations of the CDS dataset should be considered. First, policy changes affect comparability across years. Following the UC system’s adoption of a test-blind admissions policy, standardized test metrics were removed or inconsistently reported, which alters how academic preparation is represented. Second, because CDS values are aggregated, the data are subject to aggregation bias, limiting analysis to population-level trends rather than individual behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, financial aid metrics may underrepresent non-resident experiences, particularly for international students who are generally ineligible for federal aid programs. Finally, reported outcomes may reflect survivorship bias, as summary statistics describe enrolled students but do not capture those who decline admission or withdraw. These factors suggest that CDS analyses are best interpreted descriptively rather than causally.\n",
