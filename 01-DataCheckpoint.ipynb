    "Admission decisions at selective public universities shape not only the composition of the student body but also reflect institutional priorities and structural constraints. Within the University of California (UC) system, campuses receive applications from multiple residency categories, including California residents (in-state), domestic non-residents (out-of-state), and international applicants. These groups differ in tuition structure, financial contribution, and application volume, making comparisons of admission and enrollment outcomes particularly important. UC San Diego (UCSD), as a highly selective public research institution, provides a useful context for examining how admission rates and yield rates vary across residency groups. Public UC admissions datasets provide counts of applicants, admitted students, and enrolled students by residency status, enabling direct analysis of both admission probabilities and post-admission enrollment behavior.<a href=\" \">1</a >\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research and institutional analyses have emphasized that understanding university access requires examining rates rather than only aggregate enrollment numbers. Summaries provided by the University of California Office of the President highlight how Proposition 209 reshaped admissions practices and underscore the importance of evaluating application, admission, and enrollment patterns separately.<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a > These analyses suggest that raw enrollment totals alone may obscure underlying differences in admissions dynamics. Empirical work examining UC admissions policies similarly demonstrates that changes in student composition may arise from shifts in applicant behavior, selection processes, and institutional factors, motivating closer examination of admission probabilities across groups.<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a >\n",
    "\n",
    "Contemporary reporting further illustrates the relevance of residency-based comparisons. Recent coverage by the Los Angeles Times documents record numbers of California applicants alongside continued international enrollment growth, highlighting how applicant pools and admissions outcomes may evolve over time.<a href=\"#ref2\">2</a > Policy commentary also points to structural barriers affecting California students, including disparities in academic preparation and access to advising resources, which may influence both application behavior and admissions outcomes.<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a > Together, these discussions motivate systematic quantitative investigation of how admission rates and yield rates differ across residency categories.\n",

    "Building on prior work, this project investigates how admission rates and yield rates differ for international, out-of-state, and in-state undergraduate applicants to UC San Diego between 2020 and 2025, and whether gaps between these groups have widened or narrowed over time.\n",

    "We hypothesize that there are distinct patterns across first generation, undocumented, and international students admitted to UC San Diego(2020-2025) across ethnicity, gender, and intended major. Specifically, due to cultural and economic factors, we believe that first generation and International will share considerable concentration in STEM-based majors, and that first generation will have a disproportionate percentage of underrepresented ethnicities while international students will show a different distribution of ethnicities and genders. \n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that the focus on STEM majors is influenced by economic stability. International students have increased costs due to travel and education expenses which may incentivize financial predictability with potential of high return when picking a major. Similarly, first generation students may prefer STEM as there is a higher financial floor and increased opportunities following graduation. On the other hand, first generation students may be disproportionately underrepresented ethnicities due to historical disparities in K-12 education, college counseling, and opportunity. International students have differing constraints which come in the form of restrictions of certain countries to send students to the US as well as socioeconomic differences across the world.  \n"

    "### Admission and yield rates over 9 year at UCSD Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset Description: UCSD Common Data Set (2017–2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "The UCSD Common Data Set (CDS) is an annual institutional report that provides standardized information on admissions, enrollment, and financial characteristics. The dataset consists of aggregated statistics, typically reported as counts, proportions, or percentages rather than individual-level records. Central variables for this project include the admission rate, defined as the proportion of applicants offered admission, and the yield rate, defined as the percentage of admitted students who ultimately enroll. These metrics are unitless proportions that capture different stages of the admissions pipeline: selection and post-admission decision-making. Because the CDS reports values by residency categories (in-state, out-of-state, international), it enables comparisons across applicant groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial variables in the CDS provide important context for interpreting these outcomes. Total Estimated Expenses, measured in U.S. Dollars (USD), represent the annual cost of attendance. Non-resident students (out-of-state and international) face substantially higher tuition than California residents, often exceeding $70,000 per year. Academic preparation measures, such as High School GPA, are reported on a weighted 4.0 scale and serve as standardized indicators of applicant academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Major Concerns and Potential Biases\n",
    "\n",
    "Several limitations of the CDS dataset should be considered. First, policy changes affect comparability across years. Following the UC system’s adoption of a test-blind admissions policy, standardized test metrics were removed or inconsistently reported, which alters how academic preparation is represented. Second, because CDS values are aggregated, the data are subject to aggregation bias, limiting analysis to population-level trends rather than individual behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, financial aid metrics may underrepresent non-resident experiences, particularly for international students who are generally ineligible for federal aid programs. Finally, reported outcomes may reflect survivorship bias, as summary statistics describe enrolled students but do not capture those who decline admission or withdraw. These factors suggest that CDS analyses are best interpreted descriptively rather than causally.\n",

    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since we're using public, aggregated admissions statistics and data from UC San Diego instead of individual records, informed consent isn't applicable in this situation. However, we'll still make sure to be sensitive in our analysis since it can influence narratives and assumptions about specific applicant groups. We'll make sure to make responsible reports in order to avoid targeting and stigmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Biases could be introduced through reporting and definition differences throughout the years. For example, how the dataset defines words like \"international\", \"out of state\", and \"in state\" could change with different reporting cycles, and the university's formating could change as well. To limit biases, we'll rely on official definitions of that year and check for consistency in demnominators, and take into account any discontinuities in reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll only collect fields needed to analyze our research question, like the year, international/out of state/in state, and admission and yield rates. We won't use individual records, names, IDs, and application attributes. In the case that we do add subgroup breakdowns (ex. by major or by UCSD colleges), we'll use small cell supression and avoid creating tables where a group could be indirectly identified. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since international/out of state/in state groups could easily be misused to argue that certain groups are more or less deserving of their acceptance/rejectance we'll present results as institutional outcomes rather than as judgements about individuals. We'll avoid using deficit language, attributing motivations, and explicitly state that many differences could reflect many factors (like application volume, financial aid, visa constraints, housing capacity) that aren't easily observable in aggregate reporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though our source is public, our intersectional tables will be more sensitive than the original public data. We'll store files in a private page, avoid sharing raw derived tabs, and only sharing aggregated output when publishing. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because we don't have individual level records and only publicly published aggregated, we can't remove an individual's data from the CDS.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll only keep anything needed for reproducibility, like links and citations and code to re download the CDS. However, we'll delete intermediate derived cross tabs, especially ones containing smaller cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our interpretation of demographic differences can be shaped by our own assumptions. We'll make sure to ground conclusions in CDS documentation, check interpretations with peers and TAs, and avoid making normative judgements about international/in state/out of state groups. We'll also try to incorporate institutional context on what reported categories mean.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The CDS isn't designed for causal inference and may not include confounders like applicant pool composition, policy changes, and reporting changes. We'll try to avoid causal language, check for discontinuities that suggest definitional changes, and refrain from making claims that can't be supported by aggregate reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll use consistent denominators and clearly label whether values are counts or percentages. We'll make sure to include totals and disclose when things are labeled as \"unknown/not reported\", avoid misleading axis scales, and avoid emphasizing categories that exaggerate differences.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our analysis only uses aggregated counts by residency group and year, and doesn't use individual records or direct identifiers. We'll try not to infer or reconstruct individual outcomes. In the case we do introduce additional subgroup analyses, we'll suppress small cells and avoid publishing cross tabs that could lead to indirect identification\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll keep our code and maintain a clear data provenance record like which CDS file and year we used, which tables, and which transformations were applied. Any recoding and suppression will be documented so results can be reproduced and corrected in case issues are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though we're not building a predictive model, we'll still make sure to be mindful of analytical choices like grouping majors and creating categories, which could function like proxies that could unfairly shift narratives. We'll make sure to justify each grouping choice.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll present both counts and proportions and show multiple perspectives like the composition of admit versus admit rates within each subgroup. This makes sure it isn't easy for a single metric to create misleading conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll include a limitations section to emphasize aggregated reporting, definitional changes across years, missing data, small cell suppression, and the fact that our results are descriptive and not meant for individual level conclusions or causal claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll regularly review the published analysis for misinterpretation risks, especially if the university changes reporting formats and definitioins. If we find a figure is misused or misleading due to changes in definitions, we'll update or retract it. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we find that our output is misleading, creates stigmas, or creates privacy risks, we'll correct it and either add clarifications or remove it. We'll document changes to maintain transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since this is a published report and not a live system/model, rollback for us would mean removing or revising figures and tables and documenting changes in a log. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A key use could be misusing demographic breakdowns to stereotype and create exclusionary arguments. We'll mitigate this by avoiding normative claims, providing contextual limitations, and adding a statement to only use it for appropriate use. \n"
