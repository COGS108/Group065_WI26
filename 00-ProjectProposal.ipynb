    "Understanding patterns of college admissions and representation is essential for evaluating equity in public higher education. Within the University of California (UC) system, admissions policies play a major role in shaping student demographics and access to academic opportunities. UC San Diego (UCSD), as one of the most selective public universities in the United States, serves as an important case study for examining representation among groups such as first-generation and international students. Public UC admissions datasets provide information on enrollment trends by residency status, ethnicity, gender, and academic interest, allowing researchers to analyze how institutional policies and broader social factors influence student representation.</a><a href=\"#ref2\">2</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "A major historical influence on UC admissions policies is Proposition 209, passed in 1996, which prohibited the consideration of race, ethnicity, or sex in public university admissions. This policy significantly altered admissions strategies across the UC system and remains central to discussions about educational equity. Research conducted by the University of California Office of the President indicates that universities adopted alternative diversity strategies after Proposition 209, including expanded outreach efforts, holistic application review, and increased emphasis on socioeconomic factors. These changes demonstrate the importance of examining how demographic representation has evolved following major policy reforms.<a href=\"#ref1\">1\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical research has explored the long-term effects of Proposition 209 and access-oriented admissions policies on underrepresented students. Studies suggest that while overall access to UC campuses has expanded, demographic representation across campuses and academic disciplines remains uneven, particularly among historically underrepresented minority groups.<a href=\"#ref3\">3</a> Additionally, recent reporting indicates increasing enrollment of California residents alongside growth in international student populations, reflecting shifting institutional priorities and financial considerations.<a href=\"#ref4\">4</a> Educational policy discussions also highlight ongoing barriers faced by California students, including disparities in academic preparation, access to counseling resources, and financial constraints that disproportionately affect first-generation applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on prior research, this project examines the demographic distribution of first-generation and international undergraduate students admitted to UC San Diego between 2018 and 2023. By analyzing how these populations intersect across ethnicity, gender, and intended major categories, this study aims to provide a clearer understanding of how admissions policies and institutional trends influence student diversity at the campus level. Focusing on UCSD allows for a more detailed evaluation of representation across academic disciplines and contributes to broader discussions about accessibility and equity in public higher education.\n",

    "We hypothesize that acceptance and yield rates will differ from international, out-of-state, and in-state student populations at UCSD from 2020 to 2025. Specifically, due to costs and travel restrictions, we believe international students will have a lower percentage yield than that of in-state and out-of-state students over the 5 year span. We also expect that acceptance rates will differ across these groups over these years in accordance with differences in finances and application priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect that International students and out-of-state students will have lower yield percentages because of the higher tuition costs of going to UCSD relative to in-state counterparts. Additionally international students have student visas and travel constraints that may force accepted students to not be able to attend. This uncertainty in the admissions process will develop lower yield results over the 5 year span between each residency group. Additionally, We expect that admissions rates across groups will differ significantly due to application priorities and admissions pools. As a public university UC San Diego must prioritize in-state admissions, but when looking at application priorities, International and out-of-state students may have advantageous academic profiles due to the diversity of their programs and an ability to pay the higher tuition costs further funding the school. \n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since we're using a public UCSD dataset, informed consent won't be required since we're not collecting data directly from individuals but instead from information available publicly via the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Admissions demographics could be biased either by the information simply being missed or by discrepancies in reporting. For example, students could have skipped their ethnicity or gender while writing their application, or there could be differences in the way a multiracial identity is recorded. Additionally, the terms \"international\" and \"first generation\" could be defined differently by different people\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our analysis focuses on intersectional categories like first generation, international, ethnicity, gender, major, and year. Because we're considering intersectional categories, this can easily create tiny groups, which could make re identification difficult without the use of names or IDs. To avoid this, we'll avoid collecting direct identifiers, only keep necessary columns, and use small cell suppression. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since results will be used to make claims about representation and equity, we'll make sure to check for biased interpretations by presenting descriptive results, clearly showing totals and denominators, highlighting limitations like discrepancies in definitions, missing information, and small cells, and making sure to use careful language to avoid implying group deficits or wrong conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though our source is public, our intersectional tables will be more sensitive than the original public data. We'll store files in a private page, avoid sharing raw derived tabs, and only sharing aggregated output when publishing. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because we don't have individual level records and only publicly published aggregated, we can't remove an individual's data from the CDS.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll only keep anything needed for reproducibility, like links and citations and code to re download the CDS. However, we'll delete intermediate derived cross tabs, especially ones containing smaller cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our interpretation of demographic differences can be shaped by our own assumptions. We'll make sure to ground conclusions in CDS documentation, check interpretations with peers and TAs, and avoid making normative judgements about groups. We'll also try to incorporate institutional context on what reported categories mean.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The CDS isn't designed for causal inference and may not include confounders like applicant pool composition, policy changes, and reporting changes. We'll try to avoid causal language, check for discontinuities that suggest definitional changes, and refrain from making claims that can't be supported by aggregate reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll use consistent denominators and clearly label whether values are counts or percentages. We'll make sure to include totals and disclose when things are labeled as \"unknown/not reported\", avoid misleading axis scales, and avoid emphasizing categories that exaggerate differences.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll keep our code and maintain a clear data provenance record like which CDS file and year we used, which tables, and which transformations were applied. Any recoding and suppression will be documented so results can be reproduced and corrected in case issues are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though we're not building a predictive model, we'll still make sure to be mindful of analytical choices like grouping majors and creating categories, which could function like proxies that could unfairly shift narratives. We'll make sure to justify each grouping choice.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll present both counts and proportions and show multiple perspectives like the composition of admit versus admit rates within each subgroup. This makes sure it isn't easy for a single metric to create misleading conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll include a limitations section to emphasize aggregated reporting, definitional changes across years, missing data, small cell suppression, and the fact that our results are descriptive and not meant for individual level conclusions or causal claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we find that our output is misleading, creates stigmas, or creates privacy risks, we'll correct it and either add clarifications or remove it. We'll document changes to maintain transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A key use could be misusing demographic breakdowns to stereotype and create exclusionary arguments. We'll mitigate this by avoiding normative claims, providing contextual limitations, and adding a statement to only use it for appropriate use. \n"
