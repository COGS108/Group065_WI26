    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since we're using public, aggregated admissions statistics and data from UC San Diego instead of individual records, informed consent isn't applicable in this situation. However, we'll still make sure to be sensitive in our analysis since it can influence narratives and assumptions about specific applicant groups. We'll make sure to make responsible reports in order to avoid targeting and stigmatization.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Biases could be introduced through reporting and definition differences throughout the years. For example, how the dataset defines words like \"international\", \"out of state\", and \"in state\" could change with different reporting cycles, and the university's formating could change as well. To limit biases, we'll rely on official definitions of that year and check for consistency in demnominators, and take into account any discontinuities in reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll only collect fields needed to analyze our research question, like the year, international/out of state/in state, and admission and yield rates. We won't use individual records, names, IDs, and application attributes. In the case that we do add subgroup breakdowns (ex. by major or by UCSD colleges), we'll use small cell supression and avoid creating tables where a group could be indirectly identified. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since international/out of state/in state groups could easily be misused to argue that certain groups are more or less deserving of their acceptance/rejectance we'll present results as institutional outcomes rather than as judgements about individuals. We'll avoid using deficit language, attributing motivations, and explicitly state that many differences could reflect many factors (like application volume, financial aid, visa constraints, housing capacity) that aren't easily observable in aggregate reporting. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though our source is public, our intersectional tables will be more sensitive than the original public data. We'll store files in a private page, avoid sharing raw derived tabs, and only sharing aggregated output when publishing. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Because we don't have individual level records and only publicly published aggregated, we can't remove an individual's data from the CDS.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll only keep anything needed for reproducibility, like links and citations and code to re download the CDS. However, we'll delete intermediate derived cross tabs, especially ones containing smaller cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our interpretation of demographic differences can be shaped by our own assumptions. We'll make sure to ground conclusions in CDS documentation, check interpretations with peers and TAs, and avoid making normative judgements about international/in state/out of state groups. We'll also try to incorporate institutional context on what reported categories mean.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The CDS isn't designed for causal inference and may not include confounders like applicant pool composition, policy changes, and reporting changes. We'll try to avoid causal language, check for discontinuities that suggest definitional changes, and refrain from making claims that can't be supported by aggregate reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll use consistent denominators and clearly label whether values are counts or percentages. We'll make sure to include totals and disclose when things are labeled as \"unknown/not reported\", avoid misleading axis scales, and avoid emphasizing categories that exaggerate differences.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our analysis only uses aggregated counts by residency group and year, and doesn't use individual records or direct identifiers. We'll try not to infer or reconstruct individual outcomes. In the case we do introduce additional subgroup analyses, we'll suppress small cells and avoid publishing cross tabs that could lead to indirect identification\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll keep our code and maintain a clear data provenance record like which CDS file and year we used, which tables, and which transformations were applied. Any recoding and suppression will be documented so results can be reproduced and corrected in case issues are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though we're not building a predictive model, we'll still make sure to be mindful of analytical choices like grouping majors and creating categories, which could function like proxies that could unfairly shift narratives. We'll make sure to justify each grouping choice.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll present both counts and proportions and show multiple perspectives like the composition of admit versus admit rates within each subgroup. This makes sure it isn't easy for a single metric to create misleading conclusions. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll include a limitations section to emphasize aggregated reporting, definitional changes across years, missing data, small cell suppression, and the fact that our results are descriptive and not meant for individual level conclusions or causal claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We'll regularly review the published analysis for misinterpretation risks, especially if the university changes reporting formats and definitioins. If we find a figure is misused or misleading due to changes in definitions, we'll update or retract it. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we find that our output is misleading, creates stigmas, or creates privacy risks, we'll correct it and either add clarifications or remove it. We'll document changes to maintain transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since this is a published report and not a live system/model, rollback for us would mean removing or revising figures and tables and documenting changes in a log. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A key use could be misusing demographic breakdowns to stereotype and create exclusionary arguments. We'll mitigate this by avoiding normative claims, providing contextual limitations, and adding a statement to only use it for appropriate use. \n"
